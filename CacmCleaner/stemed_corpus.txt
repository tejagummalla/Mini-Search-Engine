cellular arrai for the solut of graph problem a cellular

chief comput advantag offer by cellular arrai is the improv
in speed achiev by virtu of the possibl for parallel
process in thi paper it is shown that cellular arrai
ar inher well suit for the solut of mani graph
problem for exampl the adjac matrix of a graph is
easili map onto an arrai each matrix element is store
in on cell of the arrai and typic row and
column oper ar readili implement by simpl cell logic a
major challeng in the effect us of cellular arrai for
the solut of graph problem is the determin of algorithm
that exploit the possibl for parallel especi for problem whose
solut appear to be inher serial in particular sever parallel
algorithm ar present for the solut of certain span tree
distanc and path problem with direct applic to wire rout
pert chart analysi and the analysi of mani type of
network these algorithm exhibit a comput time that in mani
case grow at a rate not exceed log2 n where
n is the number of node in the graph straightforward

of thi paper give a neg answer to the question
of whether such tree should be the first exampl of

insert furthermor it can now be conclud that insert delet
